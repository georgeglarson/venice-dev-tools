Venice AI SDK - PDF Processing Test Document

This is a sample document to test the PDF processing capabilities of the Venice AI SDK.

The Venice AI SDK v2.1 introduces enhanced PDF processing with three modes:

1. Image mode: Send the PDF as an image (default behavior)
2. Text mode: Extract text from the PDF and send as text
3. Both mode: Extract both text and images, sending multiple content items

Benefits of different modes:

- Image mode is best for PDFs with complex layouts, charts, or diagrams
- Text mode is best for text-heavy documents like research papers or articles
- Both mode provides the most comprehensive analysis but uses more tokens

Example usage in code:

```typescript
// Process a PDF file with different modes
const imageContent = await venice.utils.processFile(pdfPath);
const textContent = await venice.utils.processFile(pdfPath, { pdfMode: 'text' });
const bothContent = await venice.utils.processFile(pdfPath, { pdfMode: 'both' });
```

Example usage in CLI:

```bash
# Process PDF as text
venice chat completion --model llama-3.3-70b --attach document.pdf --pdf-mode text
```

This document can be used to test the different PDF processing modes and compare their results.
