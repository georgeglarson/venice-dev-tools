# Technical Notes

This folder groups design decisions, research spikes, and post-mortems that inform the Venice Dev Tools roadmap.

Current highlights:

- `SDK_MODERNIZATION_PLAN.md` – roadmap for modularising the SDK and aligning with the Venice API surface.
- `API_CHANGES_2025.md` – field notes collected while verifying the 2025 calendar releases.
- `LOGLEVEL_FIX_NOTES.md` – rationale behind the logging overhaul that introduced the numeric `LogLevel` enum.
- `INTEGRATION_TESTING_SETUP.md` / `INTEGRATION_TESTING_STATUS.md` – historical context for the integration matrix prior to the 2025.11.5 release.
- `TRANSFORMATION_SUMMARY.md` – consolidation of earlier refactors and why certain utilities were archived.
