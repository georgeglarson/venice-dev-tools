# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Venice AI SDK

## Project Information
- **Project Name**: venice_ai_sdk
- **Programming Language**: JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Original Requirements**: Build a complete SDK for Venice AI API (https://api.venice.ai/doc/api/swagger.yaml), including an isomorphic core with webpack and CLI packages, supporting commands like `venice chat "what is AI?"`, `venice list-keys`, and `venice list-models`.

## 1. Product Definition

### 1.1 Product Goals
- Create an easy-to-use, isomorphic SDK that works seamlessly in both browser and Node.js environments
- Provide a user-friendly CLI interface for quick access to Venice AI capabilities
- Ensure full compatibility with the Venice AI API while abstracting away complexity

### 1.2 User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want to integrate Venice AI text generation capabilities into my web application, so that I can enhance my app with AI features without handling complex API interactions.

2. **As a developer**, I want to use the Venice AI SDK in both browser and server environments with the same API surface, so that I can maintain consistent code across my frontend and backend.

3. **As a CLI user**, I want to quickly generate AI text responses without writing code, so that I can experiment with the Venice AI capabilities directly from my terminal.

4. **As a team administrator**, I want to list and manage my Venice AI API keys through a CLI, so that I can securely handle authentication without accessing the web dashboard.

5. **As a developer**, I want to explore available Venice AI models through a simple interface, so that I can make informed decisions about which models to use for different purposes.

### 2.3 UI Design Draft

#### CLI Interface Design

1. **Command Structure**
   ```
   venice <command> [options] [arguments]
   ```

2. **Help Output**
   ```
   Usage: venice [command] [options]

   Commands:
     chat <prompt>            Generate a chat response
     list-models              List available AI models
     list-keys                List stored API keys
     help [command]           Display help for command

   Options:
     -v, --version            Output version information
     -h, --help               Display help for command
     -o, --output <format>    Output format (text, json, markdown)
     -k, --key <key>          Use specific API key
     -m, --model <model>      Specify model to use
   ```

3. **Example Commands**
   ```
   $ venice chat "What is artificial intelligence?"
   > Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines...

   $ venice list-models --output json
   > [{
       "id": "llama-3.3-70b",
       "capabilities": ["text-generation", "function-calling"],
       "contextWindow": 128000
     }, ...]

   $ venice list-keys
   > Available API keys:
     - default: sk_ven_****abcd (active)
     - test: sk_ven_****efgh
   ```

#### SDK Interface Design

1. **Initialization**
   ```javascript
   // Node.js
   const { VeniceAI } = require('venice-ai-sdk');
   
   // Browser
   import { VeniceAI } from 'venice-ai-sdk';
   
   const venice = new VeniceAI({
     apiKey: 'sk_ven_...',
     defaultModel: 'llama-3.3-70b'
   });
   ```

2. **Chat Completion**
   ```javascript
   // Promise-based
   const response = await venice.chat.completions.create({
     messages: [
       { role: 'user', content: 'What is AI?' }
     ],
     model: 'llama-3.3-70b'
   });
   
   console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);
   
   // Streaming
   const stream = await venice.chat.completions.create({
     messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Tell me a story' }],
     model: 'llama-3.3-70b',
     stream: true
   });
   
   for await (const chunk of stream) {
     process.stdout.write(chunk.choices[0]?.delta?.content || '');
   }
   ```

3. **Model Listing**
   ```javascript
   const models = await venice.models.list();
   console.log(models.data);
   ```

4. **Key Management**
   ```javascript
   // List API keys
   const keys = await venice.keys.list();
   console.log(keys);
   ```

### 2.4 Open Questions

1. **API Key Management**:
   - How should API keys be securely stored locally for the CLI?
   - Should we implement key rotation or expiry management?

2. **Error Handling**:
   - How detailed should error messages be for different types of failures?
   - What retry strategies should be implemented for transient failures?

3. **Compatibility**:
   - How should we handle compatibility with future Venice API changes?
   - To what extent should we maintain compatibility with OpenAI's SDK interface?

4. **Performance**:
   - What optimization techniques should be implemented for browser environments?
   - How should we handle large response payloads in memory-constrained environments?

5. **CLI Enhancement**:
   - Should we implement an interactive shell mode similar to Python's REPL?
   - How should we handle multi-turn conversations in the CLI?

## 4. Conclusion

The Venice AI SDK will provide a comprehensive, user-friendly interface to the Venice AI API, with both programmatic and command-line access options. By adopting an isomorphic architecture, it will enable developers to use the same code in both browser and Node.js environments, simplifying integration and reducing development effort.

The SDK will prioritize developer experience with clear documentation, helpful error messages, and intuitive interfaces. It will support all required functionality including chat completions, model listing, and API key management, with room for future expansion as the Venice AI platform evolves.

By analyzing competing products and focusing on the identified user needs, the Venice AI SDK aims to position itself as a developer-friendly, feature-rich solution in the AI SDK landscape.
