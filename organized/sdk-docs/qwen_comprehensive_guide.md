# Simplified Guide for Venice AI SDK Implementation

**IMPORTANT: Please refer to the updated implementation plan at `organized/sdk-docs/venice_ai_sdk_remaining_tasks.md` for the most current and detailed list of remaining tasks.**

This document provides guidance for implementing the remaining improvements to the Venice AI SDK.

## Current Status

Many tasks have already been completed:

- ✅ Basic validation utilities have been implemented
- ✅ Chat, Images, and Models validators have been created
- ✅ Validation has been added to the chat endpoint
- ✅ Documentation structure has been created
- ✅ Client and endpoint API documentation has been written

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Input Validation
- Add validation to images endpoint
- Add validation to models endpoint

### 2. Documentation
- Create getting started guide
- Add JSDoc comments to client
- Add JSDoc comments to endpoints
- Add examples for common use cases

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Create rate limiter utility
- Update client configuration options
- Add rate limiting to HTTP client
- Optimize high-traffic code paths

### 4. Observability and Logging
- Create logger utility
- Add logging to client
- Add request/response logging
- Add error logging

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Focus on one task at a time
2. Refer to the example files in `organized/sdk-docs/examples/` directory
3. Follow the existing code style and patterns
4. Ensure compatibility with both Node.js and browser environments
5. Mark tasks as completed in the checklist after implementation

## Key Files to Create

```
venice-ai-sdk/packages/core/src/utils/rate-limiter.ts
venice-ai-sdk/packages/core/src/utils/logger.ts
venice-ai-sdk/docs/guides/getting-started.md
```

## Key Files to Modify

```
venice-ai-sdk/packages/core/src/api/endpoints/images/index.ts (add validation)
venice-ai-sdk/packages/core/src/api/endpoints/models/index.ts (add validation)
venice-ai-sdk/packages/core/src/client.ts (add JSDoc, logging, rate limiting)
venice-ai-sdk/packages/core/src/http/client.ts (add request/response logging)
```

## Example Implementation Request

"Please implement validation in the images endpoint. Add the validateGenerateImageRequest function to the generate method in venice-ai-sdk/packages/core/src/api/endpoints/images/index.ts."

## Reporting Progress

After implementing each task, provide a brief summary of:
1. What you implemented
2. Which files you modified or created
3. Any challenges you encountered
4. Which task to tackle next

This simplified guide focuses on the remaining tasks, making it easier for smaller models to execute the implementation plan.
