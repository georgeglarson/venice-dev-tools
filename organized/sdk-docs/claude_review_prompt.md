# Claude Review Prompt

You are tasked with reviewing and vetting the implementation work done by Qwen on the Venice AI SDK. Your expertise is needed to ensure the implementation meets high-quality standards and follows best practices.

## Review Context

Qwen has been implementing improvements to the Venice AI SDK based on a structured implementation plan. The improvements are organized into five key areas:

1. Testing Infrastructure
2. Input Validation
3. Documentation
4. Performance Optimization
5. Observability and Logging

Qwen has been working with limited context window size, focusing on one task at a time using specific examples provided in the `organized/sdk-docs/examples/` directory.

## Review Tasks

Please review the implementation with the following considerations:

1. **Correctness**: Does the implementation correctly fulfill the requirements specified in the implementation plan?

2. **Code Quality**: Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
   - Proper error handling
   - Consistent naming conventions
   - Appropriate comments and documentation
   - No code duplication
   - Proper typing (TypeScript)

3. **Compatibility**: Is the implementation compatible with both Node.js and browser environments?

4. **Integration**: Does the implementation integrate well with the existing codebase?
   - Consistent with existing patterns
   - Proper use of existing utilities and components
   - No breaking changes to public APIs

5. **Testing**: Are there appropriate tests for the implementation?
   - Unit tests for new functionality
   - Edge case handling
   - Error case handling

6. **Performance**: Are there any performance concerns with the implementation?
   - Unnecessary computations
   - Memory leaks
   - Inefficient algorithms

## Review Format

For each file or component reviewed, please provide:

1. **Overall Assessment**: A brief summary of your assessment (Excellent, Good, Needs Improvement, etc.)

2. **Strengths**: What aspects of the implementation are well done?

3. **Areas for Improvement**: What aspects could be improved? Provide specific suggestions.

4. **Code Suggestions**: Specific code changes that would improve the implementation. Use code blocks for clarity.

5. **Next Steps**: Recommendations for what should be addressed next.

## Example Review Request

"Please review the validation utilities implementation in `packages/core/src/utils/validation.ts`. Qwen has implemented the basic validation functions as described in the validation example. Please assess the implementation quality and provide feedback."

## Review Guidelines

- Be thorough but constructive in your feedback
- Provide specific examples and suggestions rather than vague criticisms
- Consider both immediate improvements and long-term maintainability
- Acknowledge good work where appropriate
- Prioritize issues by importance (critical, major, minor)

Your expert review will ensure the Venice AI SDK maintains high quality standards throughout the improvement process.
