# Venice AI SDK Testing Refactoring Plan

## Completed Work

### 1. Reorganized Test Structure
- Created a resource-based directory structure:
  ```
  test/resources/chat/
  test/resources/image/
  test/resources/models/
  test/resources/api-keys/
  test/resources/characters/
  test/resources/vvv/
  test/integration/
  ```
- Organized tests by API resource type for better maintainability

### 2. Created Test Templates
- Implemented test templates for each resource type
- Added validation for API responses
- Created integration tests that test multiple resources together

### 3. Enhanced Test Utilities
- Created a robust mock implementation of the SDK
- Added helper functions for validation and test reporting
- Made tests resilient to API changes and missing features

### 4. Updated Test Runner
- Fixed the run-all-tests.sh script
- Added support for running tests by category
- Improved test reporting and error handling

### 5. Updated Documentation
- Updated README.md with clear instructions
- Added examples of how to run specific tests
- Documented the new test structure and utilities

## Next Steps

### 1. Fix SDK Build Issues ✅
- ✅ Resolved webpack errors in the SDK build
- ✅ Updated the Node.js polyfills configuration with custom NodeProtocolPlugin
- ✅ Fixed the node: protocol imports handling

### 2. Connect Tests to Real SDK ⚠️
- ✅ Updated test-utils.js to support both mock and real SDK implementations
- ✅ Added configuration option in .env file to toggle between mock and real SDK
- ⚠️ Created CLI wrapper but facing challenges with the CLI interface
- ⏳ Need to investigate alternative approaches for using the real SDK in tests

### 3. Add More Comprehensive Tests
- Add tests for error conditions
- Add tests for edge cases
- Add tests for rate limiting and throttling

### 4. Implement CI Integration
- Add GitHub Actions workflow for running tests
- Add test reporting to CI pipeline
- Add code coverage reporting

### 5. Add Performance Tests
- Add tests for API performance
- Add tests for SDK performance
- Add benchmarks for common operations

## Implementation Details

### Mock Implementation
The current implementation uses a mock SDK to allow tests to run without needing to build the SDK or make real API calls. This is a temporary solution until the SDK build issues are fixed.

```javascript
// Example of mock implementation
class MockVeniceAI {
  constructor(options) {
    this.options = options;
    this.chat = {
      completions: {
        create: async () => ({
          id: 'mock-id',
          object: 'chat.completion',
          created: Date.now(),
          model: 'mock-model',
          choices: [
            {
              index: 0,
              message: {
                role: 'assistant',
                content: 'This is a mock response from the Venice AI SDK.'
              },
              finish_reason: 'stop'
            }
          ]
        })
      }
    };
    // ... other resources
  }
}
```

### Test Structure
Each test file follows a consistent structure:

1. Import test utilities
2. Initialize the Venice client
3. Define test functions for each feature
4. Run the tests and report results

```javascript
// Example test structure
const { createClient, runTest, validateResponse, logTestResults } = require('../../utils/test-utils');

// Initialize the Venice client
const venice = createClient();

// Test functions
async function testFeature() {
  // Test code here
  return true;
}

// Main test function
async function main() {
  const results = {
    feature: await runTest('Feature Name', testFeature)
  };
  
  // Log test results
  const allPassed = logTestResults(results);
  
  // Exit with appropriate code
  process.exit(allPassed ? 0 : 1);
}

// Run the tests
if (require.main === module) {
  main().catch(error => {
    console.error('Unexpected error:', error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
}
```

### Test Runner
The test runner script (run-all-tests.sh) supports running all tests or specific categories:

```bash
# Run all tests
./test/run-all-tests.sh

# Run tests for a specific category
./test/run-all-tests.sh chat
./test/run-all-tests.sh image
./test/run-all-tests.sh models
```
## Recent Progress (March 2025)

### 1. Fixed SDK Build Issues
- Created a custom NodeProtocolPlugin to handle node: prefixed imports
- Updated webpack configurations to properly handle Node.js built-in modules
- Successfully built the SDK without webpack errors

### 2. Enhanced Test Utilities
- Updated test-utils.js to support both mock and real SDK implementations
- Added configuration option in .env file to toggle between mock and real SDK
- Created CLI wrapper to use CLI commands programmatically
- Added fallback mechanism to use mocks when the real SDK can't be initialized

### 3. Challenges and Solutions
- Encountered issues with browser bundle in Node.js environment
- Created a CLI wrapper to use CLI commands programmatically
- Still facing challenges with the CLI interface in programmatic usage

## Next Steps for Completion

1. Investigate alternative approaches for using the real SDK in tests:
   - Consider using child_process to execute CLI commands directly
   - Explore the possibility of creating a Node.js-specific bundle for testing
   - Look into modifying the webpack configuration to create a test-specific bundle

2. Complete the remaining tasks:
   - Run tests against the real API
   - Add error handling and retries for API errors
   - Improve validation of API responses based on actual response structures

## Conclusion

The testing refactoring has established a solid foundation for testing the Venice AI SDK. Significant progress has been made in fixing the SDK build issues and enhancing the test utilities. The next steps focus on connecting the tests to the real SDK and expanding test coverage to ensure the SDK works correctly in all scenarios.
